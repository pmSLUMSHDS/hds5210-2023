        "BACKGROUND INFO: I had initially planned to do my final project on rise of telemedicine and telehealth, especially since COVID, and how effective or ineffective it has been. Unfortunately, I had an extremely difficult time locating enough useful datasets that could be combined in some meaningful way. So I moved on from that idea and decided on looking at the levels of contaminants in the drinking water in MA (where I currently reside), and how that might correlate to the birth defect rates in the state and cancer rates. I have pulled informtion from 2011-2015 for all counties in MA. The plan is to get it loaded, cleaned (if necessary), merged by counties, to see how the numbers stack up.\n",
