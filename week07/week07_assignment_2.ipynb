That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

I have taken 2 semesters of R and they seemed to elude in those courses that python was a simpler way of doing the same thing. I'm not sure it's easier. As with R, the punctuation is vitally important, and it gets me every time. One little misplaced comma in an otherwise perfectly written line of code and you've got syntax errors for days. And it's not always evident what the problem is so you waste 3 hours....on a comma. Almost funny if it wasn't so sad :)"
