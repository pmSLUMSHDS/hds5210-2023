        "Currently thinking about the emergence of Telehealth....how that has changed since COVID when it really spiked, is it still as popular, is it improving health outcomes. Are these doctor patient interactions effective? Is it used more by one age group than another or it is used more where there is a shortage of PCPs, so remotely visiting a doctor could be helpful? It is convenient, so maybe that alone could drive numbers up...no driving, no changing clothes, and no scale...the absolute worst part of any doctor visit. What do most people get seen for? I would think that you need the doctor to truly see what it is you are talking about...the lesion or cut or lump....you can't get that through the screen. I could be old-school though. Times are indeed changing.....I could see consulting via FaceTime for their thoughts on if I should continue on to the ER. Are people using telehealth to get that second opinion on whehter whatever they are experiencing is a true emergency....or are they truly being diagnosed with ailments during these virtual visits? Would be interesting to see the numbers on how this new trend is catching on, how it is being utilized, how accurate the diagnoses are, and if it is truly helping patient outcomes."
